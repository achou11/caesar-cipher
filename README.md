# What

[Learn more about a Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

# Why

- I've wanted to develop my interest in crytography and the Caesar cipher is very straightforward to understand.
- I typically have a hard to time figuring out a first exercise for learning a new programming language. Think this fits the bill pretty well in terms of exposure to fundamental language features.

# How

There will be a dedicated folder for each language I implement this in i.e.

```
.
|-- language-name/
  |-- solution-file
  |-- test-file
```
